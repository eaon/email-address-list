Relatively naÃ¯ve [Pest](https://pest.rs/) based parser, picking out "contacts"
from "email address lists" found in headers such as `from`, `to`, `cc`, etc.

This library aims to be practical rather than "correct". It is (potentially
excessively) permissive in parsing even the worst garbage in everyone's inbox.
Limited testing with real world data was done, but the grammar probably still
needs work to catch more edge cases.

Since this library is quite young, the API might change in `$version + 0.1`
releases, but minor ones won't break compatibility.

## Example

```rust
use email_address_list::*;

let manual: AddressList = vec![
    Contact::new("rÃ­omhphost@example.org").set_name("TÃºsainm Sloinne"),
    Contact::new("sampla@example.org")
].into();

let result = parse_address_list(
    "TÃºsainm Sloinne <rÃ­omhphost@example.org>, sampla@example.org"
).unwrap();

assert!(result.deep_eq(&manual));
```
